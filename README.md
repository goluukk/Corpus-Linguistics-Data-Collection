# Corpus-Linguistics-Data-Collection
This repository is for collecting some data from a few datasets
We will be utilising the following datasets
    1. CLMET-3
    2. HUM19UK
    3.TenIndivCorpus


I have uploaded one file from each of these corpora into the github repo. We can use this data to initially test, and possibly add a few more eventually.
